* Information Extraction
- Named Entity Recognition (NER): **sequence** models such as RNNs, HMMs or CRFs
- Relation Extraction: mostly **classifiers**, either binary or multi-class
- This lecture: how to frame these two tasks in order to apply sequence labellers and classifiers
** Named Entity Recognition
*** Typical Entity Tags
- PER: people, characters
- ORG: companies
- LOC: regions
- GPE: countries, states
- FAC: bridges, buildings, airports
- VEH: planes,cars
*** NER as sequence labelling
- NE tags can be ambigious
- Washington can be a person, location, or political entity
- Similar problem when doing POS tagging
- Can we use a sequence tagger for this? (e.g. HMM)
  - No entities can spawn multiple tokens
  - Solution: modify the tag set
*** State of the Art
- Uses LSTMs with character and word embeddings
** Relation Extraction
- Traditionally framed as triple extraction:
  - unit(American Airlines, AMR Corp) -> subsidiary
  - spokesman(Tim Wagner, American Airlines) -> employment
*** Methods
- If we have access to a fixed relation database:
  - Rule based
  - Supervised
  - Semi-supervised
  - Distant supervision
