* Question Answering
*Definition:* question answering ("QA") is the task of automatically determinging the answer for a natural language question.
** 2 key approaches
 - Information Retrieval based QA
   - Given a query, search relevant documents.
   - Find answers within these relevant documents.
 - Knowledge based QA
   - Builds semantic representation of the query.
   - Query database of facts to find answers.
** IR based QA
*** IR-based Factoid QA: TREC-QA
 1) Use question to make a query for the IR engine.
 2) Find document, and passage within document
 3) Extract short answer string
**** Question Processing
 - Find key parts of question that will help retrieval
   - discard structural parts (wh-word, ?, etc)
   - forumlate as tf-idf query, using unigrams or bigrams
   - identify entities and prioritise match
 - May reformulate question using templates
   - e.g. "Where is Federation Square located?"
     - query = "Federation Square located"
 - Predict expected answer type (here = LOCATION)
**** Answer Types
- Find a concise answer to the question, as a span in the text.
** Feature-Based Answer Extraction
 - Frame it as a classification problem
 - Classify whether a candidate answer contains an answer
 - Various features based on match to question,
   expected entity type match, specific answer patterns.
** Neural Answer Extraction
- Use a neural network to extract answer
- AKA *reading comprehension* task
